            <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                As an educator, my primary goal is to cultivate an engaging and inclusive learning environment 
                that fosters critical thinking, curiosity, and a passion for lifelong learning. 
                I believe in the transformative power of education and its ability to empower individuals to reach their full potential. 
                My personal philosophy on instructing growth can be summarized with the five words of 
                loyalty, cooperation, leadership, industry, and love.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Loyalty:</h3>
            <p>
                I adopt a sense of support, responsibility, and commitment to many of my actions and goals in my life. 
                Not only do I have a sense of loyalty to my students, co-workers, and course objectives, 
                but I also hope to instill a sense of loyalty in my students. 
                Showing them the importance of showing up to class, putting in the work, and completing their responsibilities 
                to the course and themselves. Hopefully, instilling a sense of commitment, that through dedicated practice, 
                helps them accomplish their goals.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Cooperation:</h3>
            <p>
                Cooperation is really about working together and saying, "How can we accomplish these tasks?" 
                Sometimes, students ask me, "What's the most valuable tool? What should I learn? Should it be Unity? 
                Unreal? Photoshop?" etc etc, and I'll answer by saying, "Your most valuable tool is your team. 
                Being able to work cooperatively with others to accomplish a task is essential."
            </p>
            <h3>3. Leadership:</h3>
            <p>
                Leadership doesn't necessarily mean barking out orders. Sometimes it means acting as an example, 
                taking the time to check in with your team, and making sure that everything is falling into place. 
                I work to act exemplary and encourage my students to act similarly.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Industry:</h3>
            <p>
                No, not like preparing students for industry, while that is certainly a goal, 
                I speak of the second definition that deals with hard work and producing things. 
                I believe that making things and getting our hands dirty with field experience is important. 
                I like to structure my classes with small guided exercises, that build into medium homeworks, 
                and finally culminating in open-ended creative projects, where they can showcase mastery of the skills 
                and theory they have studied throughout the course. 
            </p>
            <h3>5. Love:</h3>
            <p>
                Lastly, I highlight love. When there is mention of love, we may think a romantic Valentine's Day full of  
                "Chocolates, roses, and kisses", but here I do not refer to romantic love. More like love from a maternal standpoint. 
                Taking care of your team, of your product, ensuring a nice space for growth. 
                If you're a gardener or have ever taken care of a pet, then you may know what I'm talking about here. 
                The love and care aspect, like maybe the fraternal or the fraternity definition of love.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, my teaching philosophy revolves around key characteristics that I view as being essential 
                to an exemplary human being. I believe the characteristics of loyalty, cooperation, leadership, industry, 
                and love help us to be the best versions of ourselves that we can be. I am forever excited about the opportunity 
                to contribute to the intellectual and personal growth of the students for whom I mentor and to inspire a love for 
                learning that extends beyond the classroom.

                    This course provides a theoretical framework covering the principles of animation and its use in game design 
                    to affect user experience. Emphasis will be placed upon principles that support character development and 
                    animations that show cause and effect. Students will apply these principles to create animations that reflect 
                    movement and character appropriate for different uses and environments.

                    This course examines the concepts of interface and interaction models in a media-specific context, 
                    with particular emphasis on the concept of the immersive interface. 
                    This course explores concepts such as perception, expectation, Gestalt Theory, interactivity, 
                    Semiotics, presence, and immersion in the context of media application development and deployment. 
                    In addition, underlying concepts of cognitive psychology and cognitive science will be integrated 
                    where appropriate. These theories are then integrated in the exploration of the immersive interface, 
                    and with related concepts such as user-level-interface modification, augmentation of identity, 
                    and the interface as a social catalyst.

                <p>
                    The rich variety and widespread adoption of gestural touch screens, motion-sensing devices, 
                    weight-reactive surfaces, wearable digital devices, and similar interface products demonstrates 
                    the demand for well-integrated devices and services that seamlessly couple people and environments. 
                    Such products can interface computers with real-world inputs and outputs, and give people new ways of 
                    controlling and experiencing their devices and information. This course provides a rapid technical 
                    introduction to basic electronics (components, circuits, microcontrollers, etc.) and emphasizes 
                    the application of interface design concepts to physically interactive and innovative product development. 
                    The course requires solo and team projects that blend electronics, programming, and design.
