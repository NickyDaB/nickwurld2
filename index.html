        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, and welcome to my professional academic website.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm <em>Nicholas A. Buonarota</em>, a Visiting Lecturer in the Interactive Games & Media department at Rochester Institute of Technology. 
            I teach game development and new media-related courses, 
            with a focus on applying game design and user experience theory to course and curriculum development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Course development is one of my core strengths in higher education. 
            Drawing on over ten years of experience in community development, research and development, and software engineering, 
            I design learning experiences that are intentional, student-centered, and grounded in real-world practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            I approach higher education through the lens of user experience design, 
            viewing each course as an interactive system that should be <em>engaging</em>, <em>accessible</em>, and <em>meaningful</em> for students.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website serves as a hub for my teaching materials, academic work, professional projects, 
            and other resources related to my career in higher education and interactive media. 
            In many ways, it's my character stats screen—a transparent look at my background, strengths, 
            and the systems I use to support student learning.
